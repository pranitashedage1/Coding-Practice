'''
AWS is a cloud computing platform with multiple servers. One of the servers is assigned to serve customer requests.
There are n customer requests placed sequentially in a queue, where the i th request has a maximum waiting time denoted by wait[i]. 
That is, if the i th request is not served within wait[i] seconds, then the request expires and it is removed from the queue. The server processes the request following the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. The 1st request is processed first, and the n th request is served last. At each second, the first request in the queue is processed. At the next second, the processed request and any expired requests are removed from the queue.
Given the maximum waiting time of each request denoted by the array wait , find the number of requests present 
in the queue at every second until it is empty.

Note:
If a request is served at some time instant t , it will be counted for that instant and is removed at the next instant.
The first request is processed at time = 0. A request expires without being processed when time = wait[i] . It must be processed while time < wait[i] .
The initial queue represents all requests at time = 0 in the order they must be processed.

Function Description
Complete the function findRequestsInQueue in the editor.
findRequestsInQueue has the following parameter:
int wait[n] : the maximum waiting time of each request

Returns
int[] : the number of requests in the queue at each instant until the queue becomes empty.

Example 1 :
Input: wait = [2, 2, 3, 1]
Output: [4, 2, 1, 0] 
Explanation:
- time = 0 seconds, the 1st request is served. The number of requests in the queue is 4. queue = [1, 2, 3, 4].
- time = 1 second, request 1 is removed because it is processed, request 4 (wait[3] = 1) is removed because time = wait[3] = 1 which exceeds its maximum waiting time. Also, request 2 is served. The number of requests in the queue at time = 1 seconds is 2. queue = [2, 3].
- time = 2 seconds, request 2 is removed because it is processed, request 3 is served. The number of requests in the queue is 1. queue = [3].
- time = 3 seconds, request 3 is removed because it is processed. The number of requests in the queue is 0. queue = [empty].
The answer is [4, 2, 1, 0].
