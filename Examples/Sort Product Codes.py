'''
Amazon has millions of products sold on its e-commerce website, and each product is identified by its product code.
Given an array of n productCodes and order , a string that represents the precedence of characters, sort the productCodes in lexicographically increasing order per the precedence.
Note: Lexicographical order is defined in the following way. When we compare strings s and t , first we find the leftmost position with different characters: s[0] and t[0]. 
If there is no such position (i.e. s is a prefix of t or vice versa), then the shorter string is prior to the longer one. Otherwise, we compare characters s[i] and t[i] according to their order in the given precedence order.

Function Description
Complete the function sortProductCodes in the editor below. sortProductCodes has the following parameter(s):
string order : the new precedence order string
productCodes[n] : the array to sort

Returns
string[n] : the productCodes array in sorted order

Example 1 :
Input: order = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", productCodes = ["adc", "abc"]
Output: ["abc", "adc"] 
Explanation: Consider the strings "adc" and "abc", the first point of difference is at position 1 (assuming start index is 0), and 'd'>'b' according to the given precedence order.

Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 5000
1 ≤ length(productCodes[i]) ≤ 100
length(order) = 26
order and all productCodes[i] contain lowercase English letters only.

def sortProductCodes(order, productCode):
    precedence = {char:index for index, char in enumerate(order)} 
    def sort_key(code):
        return [precedence[char] for char in code]

    return sorted(productCode, key=sort_key)

# Example usage
order = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
productCodes = ["adc", "abc"]
print(sortProductCodes(order, productCodes))  # Output: ["abc", "adc"]
