You are shopping online for some bags of onion. Each listing displays the number of onions that the bag contains. You want to buy a perfect set of onion bags from the entire search results list, onionBags . A perfect set of onion bags, perfect , is defined as:
The set contains at least two bags of onion.
When the onion bags in the set perfect are sorted in increasing order by count, it satisfies the condition perfect[i] = perfect[i+1] for all 1 â‰¤ i < n . Here n is the size of the set and perfect[i] is the number of onion in bag i .
Find the largest possible set perfect and return an integer, the size of that set. If no such set is possible, then return -1 . It is guaranteed that all elements in onionBags are distinct.

Example 1 :
Input: onionBags = [3, 9, 4, 2, 16]
Output: 3 
Explanation: The following are the perfect sets:
Set perfect = [3, 91]. The size of this set is 2.
Set perfect = [4, 2]. The size of this set is 2.
Set perfect = [4, 16]. The size of this set is 2.
Set perfect = [4, 2, 16]. The size of this set is 3.
The size of the largest set is 3. The image below illustrates the correct ordering of the purchased onion bags by count.
