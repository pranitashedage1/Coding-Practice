'''
Serialization is converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that 
it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be 
reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary search tree. 
There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. 
You need to ensure that a binary search tree can be serialized to a string, and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.
The encoded string should be as compact as possible.

Example 1:
Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: [2,1,3]

Example 2:
Input: root = []
Output: []
